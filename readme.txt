== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are shortcodes? How to use them on my blog/website? =

Shortcodes are nifty little pieces of code that, once inserted in your post-editor, can display various elements like buttons, notification bars, tabbed content, labels, images with cool filters, videos and even Google Maps on your website or blog. And the beauty is, you don't have to actually write the shortcode. Once you activate this plugin, you will find a new icon that looks like two brackets [] in the post-editing screen when you create or edit a blog-post or a page. Click the icon with brackets and choose from the available elements. Enter the required details in the pop-up and press ‘Insert’ to add the shortcode. Finally, save the post. The shortcode element will be displayed on your site.

= The LoveIt! button is not displayed on my site. Why? =

In your WordPress admin area, go to ‘CC Settings’ and make sure you have checked at least one out of Blog posts and Pages wherever you wish to display the LoveIt! button.
